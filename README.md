# clojure-brave-and-true

I'm learning Clojure via ["Clojure for the Brave and True"](http://www.braveclojure.com/).

This repo contains my efforts.

I'm trying to keep `project.clj` up to date so that `lein run` runs the most recent
Chapter and Exercise. Yeah... I'm also using [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).

I fully expect my early `chapterX.clj` to somewhat be in disarray - this language
is really turning back the clock for me as most of my past experience doesn't
really apply - my basic understand of good formatting and good code organization
just don't fit.

Things will get better, I'm sure :)
